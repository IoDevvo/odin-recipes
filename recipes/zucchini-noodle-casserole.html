            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is an incredibly delicious low-calorie dish.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
                <li>5 zucchini squash, cut into 'noodles' using a spiral slicer or vegetable peeler</li>
                <li>¼ cup minced garlic</li>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) jar marinara sauce, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 (7 ounce) container 2% Greek yogurt</li>
                <li>1 pinch Italian seasoning, or to taste</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste
                </li>
                <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
                </li>
                <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, saute enough zucchini to fit in the skillet with 1 teaspoon garlic until zucchini is slightly browned and softened, 3 to 6 minutes. Repeat with remaining olive oil, zucchini, and garlic. Transfer cooked zucchini mixture to a 9x13-inch baking dish.
                </li>
                <li>Whisk marinara sauce, yogurt, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper together in a saucepan over low heat; cook and stir until sauce is warmed through, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour sauce over zucchini mixture in the baking dish. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese and a pinch of Italian seasoning over the top.
                </li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling, 20 to 30 minutes.
                </li>
            </ol>
