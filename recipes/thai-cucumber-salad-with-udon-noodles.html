        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sweet with a touch of heat and very light. With minimum cooking, this is perfect for a summer night. Garnish with cilantro, sesame seeds, and lime wedges, if desired.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup rice vinegar</li>
            <li>8 ounces udon noodles, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 English cucumbers, sliced</li>
            <li>1 large shallot, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>½ red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>½ small Thai chile pepper, minced</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine sugar, water, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and salt in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar and salt are dissolved, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Stir in rice vinegar to make dressing.
            </li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook udon noodles in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain. Rinse with cold water and drain.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer udon to a large bowl. Add cucumbers, shallot, red bell pepper, and Thai chile pepper. Pour dressing into the bowl; toss until salad is evenly coated. Let stand to marinate, at least 20 minutes, before serving.
