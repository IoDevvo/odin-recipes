        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you're new to baking, you'll be happy to know that this is what we call in the business a "rustic" pastry, which means you don't have to stress about making it look perfect. If you want to do a little fine-tuning, like I did, feel free, but no one is going to have a problem if you don't. Now, running out of ice cream is another story, so make sure you're stocked. Anyway, whether it's nice and neat, or extra rustic, I really do hope you give this a try soon. 
        </p>

                    <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
                    <li>1 ½ teaspoons cornstarch</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>for the Egg and Sugar Glaze:
                <ul>
                    <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon demerara sugar</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
           <li>Combine flour, cornmeal, and salt in a bowl with a pastry blender. Add cold butter and combine with the pastry blender until coarse crumbs form. Drizzle in cold water, a little at a time, stirring to combine with a fork, until dough comes together.
        </li> 
           <li>Turn dough onto a work surface and bring together with your hands; press into a disk of dough.
        </li> 
           <li>Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.
        </li> 
           <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a Silpat® baking mat.
        </li> 
           <li>Combine blueberries, sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and cornstarch in a bowl.
        </li> 
           <li>Remove dough from the refrigerator and roll on a lightly floured work surface into a 15-inch circle, about 1/8 inch thick.
        </li> 
           <li>Place blueberry filling into the center of the dough, leaving 3 to 4 inches of space around the border of dough. Fold dough up and around the berries, rotating a few inches and make another fold, overlapping the first; repeat around the dough until pleats are formed.
        </li> 
           <li>Combine beaten egg and water in a small bowl and brush on the dough. Sprinkle on demerara sugar.
        </li> 
           <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until golden, about 45 minutes.
        </li> 
        </ol>
